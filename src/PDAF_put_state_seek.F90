! !ROUTINE: PDAF_put_state_seek --- Interface to transfer state to PDAF
!
! !INTERFACE:
SUBROUTINE PDAF_put_state_seek(U_collect_state, U_init_dim_obs, U_obs_op, &
     U_init_obs, U_prepoststep, U_prodRinvA, outflag)

! !DESCRIPTION:
! Interface routine called from the model after the 
! forecast of each ensemble state to transfer data
! from the model to PDAF.  For the parallelization 
! this involves transfer from model PEs to filter 
! PEs.\\
! During the forecast phase state vectors are 
! re-initialized from the forecast model fields
! by U\_collect\_state. 
! At the end of a forecast phase (i.e. when all 
! ensemble members have been integrated by the model)
! sub-ensembles are gathered from the model tasks.
! Subsequently the filter update is performed.
!
! The code is rather generic. However, in contrast
! to the put_state routines for ensemble-based filters,
! this variant has also to handle the central state
! the is separately forecasted.
!
! Variant for SEEK with domain decomposition.
!
! !  This is a core routine of PDAF and
!    should not be changed by the user   !
!
! !REVISION HISTORY:
! 2003-07 - Lars Nerger - Initial code
! Later revisions - see svn log
!
! !USES:
! Include definitions for real type of different precision
! (Defines BLAS/LAPACK routines and MPI_REALTYPE)
